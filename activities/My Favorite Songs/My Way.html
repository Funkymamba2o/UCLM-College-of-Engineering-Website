					[Verse 1]<br>
					And now, the end is near<br>
					And so I face the final curtain<br>
					My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
					I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br>
					I've lived a life that's full<br>
					I traveled each and every highway<br>
					And more, much more than this<br>
					I did it my way<br>
					<br>
					[Verse 2]<br>
					Regrets, I've had a few<br>
					But then again, too few to mention<br>
					I did what I had to do<br>
					And saw it through without exemption<br>
					I planned each charted course<br>
					Each careful step along the byway<br>
					And more, much more than this<br>
					I did it my way<br>
                    <br>
					[Chorus]<br>
					Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
					When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
					But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
					I ate it up and spit it out<br>
					I faced it all, and I stood tall<br>
					And did it my way<br>

					Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>

					[Verse 3]<br>
					I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
					I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
					And now, as tears subside<br>
					I find it all so amusing<br>
					To think I did all that<br>
					And may I say, not in a shy way<br>
					Oh, no, oh, no, not me<br>
					I did it my way<br>
					<br>
					[Chorus]<br>
					For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
					If not himself, then he has naught<br>
					To say the things he truly feels<br>
					And not the words of one who kneels<br>
					The record shows I took the blows<br>
					And did it my way<br>
					<br>
					[Outro]<br>
					Yes, it was my way<br>
