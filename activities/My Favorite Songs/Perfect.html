					[Verse 1]<br>
					Hey, dad, look at me<br>
					Think back and talk to me<br>
					Did I grow up according to plan?<br>
					And do you think I'm wasting my time<br>
					Doing things I wanna do?<br>
					But it hurts when you disapprove all along<br>
					<br>
					[Pre-Chorus]<br>
					And now I try hard to make it<br>
					I just wanna make you proud<br>
					I'm never gonna be good enough for you<br>
					Can't pretend that I'm alright<br>
					And you can't change me<br>
					<br>
					[Chorus]<br>
					'Cause we lost it all<br>
					Nothing lasts forever<br>
					I'm sorry<br>
					I can't be perfect<br>
					Now it's just too late<br>
					And we can't go back<br>
					I'm sorry<br>
					I can't be perfect<br>
					<br>
					[Verse 2]<br>
					I try not to think<br>
					About the pain I feel inside<br>
					Did you know you used to be my hero?<br>
					All the days you spent with me<br>
					Now seem so far away<br>
					And it feels like you don't care anymore<br>
					<br>
					Pre-Chorus]<br>
					And now I try hard to make it<br>
					I just wanna make you proud<br>
					I'm never gonna be good enough for you<br>

					[Bridge]<br>
					Nothing's gonna change the things that you said<br>
					And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)<br>
					Please don't turn your back<br>
					I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you<br>
					But you don't understand (You don't understand)<br>
